# AI Wordle
The Wordle game implemented in Prolog is a simplified version of the popular word guessing game. In this game, players have 6 attempts to guess a secret 5-letter word chosen from a predefined list of acceptable words. After each guess, players receive feedback indicating the correctness of their guess. The game continues until the player either correctly guesses the word or exhausts their attempts.

Wordle is a game that effectively uses Artificial Intelligence because of its dependence upon search-based algorithms and planning systems. The concept of generating a random word, allowing user input, and providing feedback after every guess requires algorithms to search words and check their validity to provide accurate feedback. It also requires a planned structure to select a correct five letter word to initialize the game. 

Our project was driven by two main interests: exploring Artificial Intelligence and integrating it into a familiar game.
